# Security Winner — Startup Idea Exploration by Deividas Strole

**Security Winner** is an early-stage **startup idea exploration** implemented in Java. The project was created by **Deividas Strole** to prototype concepts around security-focused logic, competitive mechanics, and rule-based decision systems.

This repository represents a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** rather than a finished product. The goal was to explore feasibility, core logic, and technical direction before committing to a full production build.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

Security Winner was conceived as an experimental platform to explore:

- Security-oriented logic and validation rules  
- Competitive or scoring-based mechanics  
- Decision-making algorithms  
- Foundational architecture for a future scalable system  

The project focuses on **idea validation through code**, not on polish or commercial readiness.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explored

- Rule-based decision logic  
- Input validation and control flow  
- Algorithmic evaluation of outcomes  
- Clean separation of responsibilities  
- Extendable structure for future security features  

This codebase served as a technical sandbox to test assumptions and architectural ideas.
